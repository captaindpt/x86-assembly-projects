# x86-assembly-projects
these are all the projects i did in x86 assembly.

## Cheat Sheet folder:
This folder is a small refrence of my own and the notes i'v taken in my x86 assembly classes for future referral.

The rest of the files are random homeworks and big or little projects i did in my x86 assembly course.
the ```proj``` folder is my final project.
